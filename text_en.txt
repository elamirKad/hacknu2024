Why does a hedgehog need an apple?

You may have seen many times a hedgehog carrying an apple on his back from a book or cartoon. The back and sides of the hedgehog are covered with needle armor. And its spines are located above the contracting muscles. When the hedgehog contracts, it comes out in a round shape. But it is impossible to get rid of all enemies. It is especially difficult to get rid of ticks and fleas that live among thorns. To get rid of them, the hedgehog puts a bitter apple on it and cleans itself.

The length of its spines is 3 cm. The number of spines on the body reaches from 7000 to 10000. Thorns are always renewed. Its thorns fall 3 times in a year. And instead of fallen thorns, new ones grow.
The spines of some hedgehogs are poisonous. But this poison does not spread from the hedgehog's body. He applies the poison secreted by the toad to his spines.
Even the poison of a poisonous gray snake cannot kill hedgehogs. Kushun solution, sulema, and mold acid do not threaten his life. They live up to 3 years in the wild, and up to 10 years in captivity.
